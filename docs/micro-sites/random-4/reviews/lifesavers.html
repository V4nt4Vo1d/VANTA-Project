    <p>
        Purchased these under the impression that they would, at minimum, 
        prevent me from drowning. They are called Life Savers. 
        This feels like a simple contractual agreement.
    </p>

    <p>
        To test effectiveness, I entered a community pool holding five of them,
        confident in the product’s life-preserving capabilities. 
        I immediately sank. None of the candies offered flotation, assistance, 
        or even moral support.
    </p>

    <p>
        A child nearby ate one of my “rescue tools” and walked off, 
        completely unbothered. This seemed cruel.
    </p>

    <p>
        One star because the flavors are pleasant, but in terms of saving lives,
        they performed catastrophically below expectations.

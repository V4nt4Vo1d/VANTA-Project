    <p>
        I bought this because I assumed, reasonably, that it would be a stick to light fires. 
        Like a torch. Like something to be used on a long camping trip to start the bonfires.

        Instead it’s just a plastic rectangle that connects to the TV. 
        No flames, no sparks, not even warm to the touch.

        I tried rubbing two Fire Sticks together hoping to generate at least a little heat. 
        Nothing.  
        My ancestors are ashamed.

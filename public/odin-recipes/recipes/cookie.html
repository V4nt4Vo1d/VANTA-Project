    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 ¾ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup brown sugar, packed</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons dark corn syrup</li>
    </ul>

<div id="instructions" class="setup">
    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sift flour, baking soda, cinnamon, cloves, ginger, and cardamom into a large bowl.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat butter, white sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Then beat in the egg and dark corn syrup until smooth. Gradually stir in the flour/spice mixture until evenly combined. Divide dough into four portions, wrap in plastic, and refrigerate at least 1 hour (or overnight).</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 375 °F (190 °C). Lightly grease baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Working with one dough disk at a time (keep the others chilled), roll out on a lightly floured surface to about ⅛ inch thickness. Cut into shapes with cookie cutters, dipping cutters in flour to prevent sticking. Place shapes about 1 inch apart on prepared sheets.</li>
        <li>Bake for about 5 minutes, until set. Transfer cookies to a wire rack to cool. Repeat with remaining dough portions.</li>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      Founded accidentally after someone said “wouldn’t it be funny if…,” our rescue now proudly
      supports a wide variety of nonexistent animals. From cats made of stars to dogs who smell like pastries,
      we’re committed to giving every fictional creature a permanent place on the internet.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Actually Do</h2>
    <p>
      This site is just for fun — a place to laugh, enjoy cute animals, and maybe share a page with a friend.
      If you're inspired to adopt, foster, or help real animals, please contact your <strong>local shelters</strong>.

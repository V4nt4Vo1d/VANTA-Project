    <h2>About Tinker</h2>
    <p>
      Tinker has the posture of someone who definitely knows where the missing squeaky toys went
      — but legally cannot disclose that information. 
      He sits like a tiny crime boss evaluating your usefulness to his organization. 
      If a toy disappears in this household, Tinker “wasn’t even there,” but also “has an associate who can look into it.”

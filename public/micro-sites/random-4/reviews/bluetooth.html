    <p>
        Bought Bluetooth headphones expecting—bare minimum—a single tooth to turn blue. 
        That’s the promise in the name. 
        Not one molar, incisor, or bicuspid shifted hue.
    </p>
    <p>
        I even checked in different lighting. 
        Bathroom mirror, car mirror, phone flashlight. 
        My dentist laughed at me but confirmed: 
        “Sir, your teeth are disappointingly normal.”
    </p>
    <p>
        Two stars because the sound quality was fine, but spiritually? A total letdown.

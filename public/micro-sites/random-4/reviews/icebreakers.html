    <p>
        I bought these mints specifically for a work event where I planned to network like a socially competent adult. 
        I popped an Ice Breaker in my mouth, walked up to a stranger, and attempted to initiate conversation. 
        The ice remained very much unbroken. 
    </p>
    <p>
        At one point I accidentally made eye contact with a man near the cheese table. 
        I smiled, mint in mouth, ready for the product to *do its job.* Instead, the man frowned and walked away. 
        Not only did the ice not break, it somehow **got thicker**.
    </p>
    <p>
        Zero points. Minty but emotionally useless.

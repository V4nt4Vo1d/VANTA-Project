    <p>
        I put it in my pocket. It got hot. I suppose that means it worked. 
        But then my leg got hot, my jeans got hot, and my confidence cooled dramatically.

    <p>
        Zero warning labels about pocket-based usage. 
        The product name strongly implies that pockets are the intended vessel.

    <p>
        Two stars because it smelled incredible, and because technically speaking, the pocket was indeed hot.
